### 2️⃣ **Number Guessing Game**
**File:** `num.java`

#### 📝 Description
A fun mini-game where the computer randomly generates a number between **1 and 100**, and the user tries to guess it!

#### 🎮 How It Works
- The program generates a **random number**.
- The user enters their **guess**.
- The program gives feedback:
  - ✅ If your guess matches — *"Guess is correct"*
  - 🔼 If your guess is too high — *"Your guess is too high... Try again!"*
  - 🔽 If your guess is too low — *"Your guess is too low... Try again!"*

#### 💡 Example Output
```
ENTER YOUR GUESSED NUMBER FROM 1 TO 100 : 45

GENERATED NUMBER IS : 62

Your guess is too low... Try again!....
```

## 🚀 How to Run These Programs

### Option 1 — Using Command Line
1. Save the files as:
   - `Main.java`
   - `num.java`
2. Compile and run each file separately:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   java Main
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   javac num.java
   java num
   ```

### Option 2 — Using IDE
- Open any Java IDE (like VS Code, IntelliJ, or Eclipse)
- Create two separate files (`Main.java` and `num.java`)
- Run them individually.
